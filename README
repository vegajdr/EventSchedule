Hi! To use this program download the files and run app.rb in your terminal to start your server

To add an event, submit a POST request with a JSON body:

post = HTTParty.post "http://localhost:4567/events",
body: '{"title": "Day off", "description": "Just trying to stay sane", "month": 6, "day": 7, "year": 2016, "zipcode": "27530" }',
headers: { "Authorization" => "user" }

To see all events, submit a GET request:

HTTParty.get "http://localhost:4567/events",
headers: { "Authorization" => "user" }

To see a specific event by date, submit a GET request with month/day/year params:

date = HTTParty.get "http://localhost:4567/events/6/7/2016",
headers: { "Authorization" => "user" }
